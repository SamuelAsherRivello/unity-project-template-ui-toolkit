----------------------

WORKFLOW: PROS
* Global styles (e.g. all layouts)
* Shared styles (e.g. all page layouts)
* Unshared styles (e.g. layout specific)
* Excellent cascading of styles. 
* Excellent theming (dark is default at **BOTH** edit-time and runtime)
* Excellent use of UI Builder (100% proper preview of all layout, styles, variables... except "pending")

WORKFLOW: CONS
* (None)

WORKFLOW: PENDING
* How to auto-complete when entering CUSTOM VARIABLES in ui builder? Given my particular, CUSTOM file setup, I'm not seeing it.

----------------------

DEMOS: COMPOSABILITY
* 1. Custom component via C#, UXML, USS = Included in demo. RECOMMENDED as the default workflow. See "ThemeButton" & "ListItem"
* 2. Custom component via UXML, USS = Included in demo. This is a less desirable alternative. See "Line"
* 3. Custom component via "Template" = Not included in this demo. It may be worth exploring as a least-desirable alternative.

----------------------

TODO
* Make a typical localization setup? Perhaps it's out of scope. I have another demo repo for that.
